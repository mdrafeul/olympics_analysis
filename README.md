# olympics_analysis
I tried to analysis Olympics events dataset over the year.

## About

<p>In this project I tried to analysis Olympics dataset from Kaggle. The objective of the project is finding the different kind of statistics about Olympics. This project is divided into four parts i) Medal Tally, ii) Overall analysis, iii) Country-wise analysis and iv) Athletes-wise analysis. To properly visualize I used streamlit library.</p>

## Usage
- Install streamlit 
- Clone the directory 
- In the directory run your shell and type 'streamlit run app.py

## Overview of the Analysis
Some hightlights and images are included below. 
<p>The <strong>Medal Tally</strong> section represent a table of country and coressponing medals. But its also possible ot filter medal tally based country and event year.</p>

<p>In <strong>Overall Analysis</strong> section, I have presented total statistics like number of editions, total participated athletes, countries etc. There is a heatmap of events per edition, a line graph of events over the years and  a table of successful athletes which is filterable based on types sports categories. </p>
